# Purpose

This release escapes the values for multiple key-value pairs, to account for
variables that evaluate to a string startiwht with a special character (e.g.,
"|" or "<")

# Enhancements

* N/A

# Bug Fixes

* Multiple strings are now surrounded with quotes to prevent YAML parsing 
errors on certain values. For example, the auth token for the Red Hat 
registries typically take the form of “<account-number>|uhc-pool-<GUID>”, but 
there are edge cases where “<account-number>”is blank, creating a token of 
“|uhc-pool-<GUID>”.
